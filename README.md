# Woof-Pet-Care-System

Woof (A pet care system) is an alternative to ruthless shelter homes or expensive pet care centers, where the pet owner can scroll through dozens of pet lovers with whom he wishes to keep his pet. The main aim of our platform is to relieve pet owners from the guilt associated when traveling without their pet or leaving them in a boarding kennel. On our platform, the pet lover has to make an account and set up their profile mentioning where they stay, their experience with the types of pets, their cost to keep different kinds of pets, and whether or not they will provide food during the stay. Once a profile has been set up, it will be visible in the listings to the pet owner. Pet owners can make a decision based on ratings and reviews as to whom they want to keep their pet with. 
The pet lovers can register themselves by depositing a security amount, identity proof, and other details. Their years of experience and ratings will move them on top of the search result of the pet owner.
